#FOLDER EXPLANATION:
-The java code for all the exercises can be found by their titles which specifies the exact exercise number containing the solution.
-Each solution is compatible with java8 and can be compiled again using the javac (uses the java virtual machine to convert the java code to bytecode, which can then be run using the jdk).

-The java solutions have also been compiled into .class files to be able to run them straight away.

-The class files are: ExerciseOne, ExerciseTwo, ExerciseThree, ExerciseFour, ExerciseFive.

#RUNNING THE EXERCISES:

1.First you must get inside the directory of the folder by using the cd command + name of file which is EBRD_SOLUTIONS

2. Enter java + exercise name e.g., ExerciseTwo

3. The program will run, and you can test it out. It will end when a result has been given. 
You can choose to manually edit the code of the .java file of the exercise then compile it again and run it by using the java + exercise name command.

4.You can run the java + exercise name command again to test out another exercise.

Hope it all makes sense and is clear. In my demonstration I will run it using IntelliJ as my preferred IDE.
